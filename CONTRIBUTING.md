## 🧭 Contribution Philosophy

AOS is built with these principles in mind:

- **Core-first design** — stability and security matter
- **Automation-driven** — reduce repetition, increase efficiency
- **Clean, maintainable code** — readability over cleverness
- **Long-term thinking** — changes should age well

Contributions should respect these goals.
